Terraform Module: NAT instances (Google provider)
=================================================

A simple Terraform module for [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) that creates a NAT instance to forward
traffic from internal instances without external IP addresses to the internet.

## Why?

By default, Google Compute instances without an external IP address are unable to access the internet. Google also provides
[Cloud NAT](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview) which provides the same functionality as is implemented in this
module. However, as per https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/ports-and-addresses#ports-reuse-tcp, Google Cloud enforces a
two-minute delay before the gateway can reuse the same NAT source IP address and source port tuple with the same
destination (destination IP address, destination port, and protocol).

This poses a problem when rapidly opening and closing connections to the same destination IP, port and protocol. Google
recommends assigning an external IP address to a Google Compute instance and forwarding traffic through this instance.

This is the functionality that this module provides.

## Usage

```hcl-terraform
resource google_compute_address nat_instance {
  name = "nat-instance"
  region = "europe-west3"
}

module nat_instance_01 {
  source = "garbetjie/nat-instance/google"
  address = google_compute_address.nat_instance.address  // Required
  zone = "europe-west3-a"                                // Required
  disk_size = 15                                         // Optional
  disk_type = "pd-standard"                              // Optional
  machine_type = "f1-micro"                              // Optional
  network_tags = ["requires-nat-${local.region}"]        // Optional
  route_priority = 900                                   // Optional
  socks_proxy = { enabled = true }                       // Optional
  sysctl_config = {}                                     // Optional
  wait_duration = 10                                     // Optional
}
```
